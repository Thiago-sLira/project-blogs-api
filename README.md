<h1>Blogs API</h1>
<p>A database and an API for producing content for a blog.</p>

<h2>🚀 Objective</h2>
<p>The objective was to build a Node.js application using the Sequelize package to create a CRUD for posts. Develop endpoints that are connected to the database following the principles of REST. To make a post, it was necessary to work on the relationship between user and post.</p><br>
<p>The most challenging part of this project was performing validations for each endpoint, also creating authentication with JsonWebToken. Checking the database for user existence and if the token is valid were the moments when I developed the most.</p>
